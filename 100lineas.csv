"Does life actually work for most / non-depressed people?It doesn't seem possible to me that everyone isn't miserable. What do you think? My boyfriend told me the other week that in reality we are the minority. Most people are fine, if not happy. Oddball.",depression
"I found my friend's bodyIt was almost nine years ago now, but I still think about it every day. He was down about something so I sat with him and chatted, tried to cheer him up. He said he was fine, had just had a bit too much to drink, and that I should go to bed. That night he hanged himself in the tiny utility room of the house we shared. My ex saw him first, then yelled for me. I had to cut him down. The emergency services lady on the phone offered to talk me through attempting CPR, but I knew there was no point as he was frozen solid. I still feel I should have tried anyway, stupid as that is.

I was really messed up for years afterwards. I mean, I was slightly depressed before that anyway (undiagnosed anaemia, now under control), but it got a whole lot worse. I pushed all my friends away, became very social phobic. I'd have panic attacks if I had to talk to people I didn't know. Dropped out of uni. The only thing stopping me from killing myself was not wanting to put people through what I'd been through. One day, seven years after it happened, I just said fuck it and booked a ticket to the other side of the world. I think a part of me planned to die out there. I mean, it's Australia, there's so many ways to make it look like an accident. But instead I made a life for myself. I was happy, felt like a normal person for the first time ever. I was so proud of myself. 

Then a friend found her boyfriend's body and seeing her go through that acted as a trigger. The fear and the nightmares and the panic attacks started again. Eventually it all just got too much. I ended up ruining my new life because of it. Lost my job, my home, my friends. Had to move back home to England.

It's now almost a year since the trigger, and seven months since everything went to shit. I'm not coping. I still have nightmares, I'm still terrified of people, I still have panic attacks even just walking my dogs. I barely get out of bed. I don't know what to do. Back when it first happened I tried therapy and medication and none of it worked. It took seven years of absolute misery before I got 'better' last time. I don't think I have another seven years in me. Especially not when I know no matter how good things get I could still end up back as this depressed lump. I could just run away to another country again, see if that works a second time, but honestly I'm scared that if I leave here in this state of mind I'll be a danger to myself. I'm a danger to myself already. I take strong painkillers to get me through the days and I've reached the point where I'm taking so many that I know I'm risking liver damage, especially as I drink heavily too, but I can't seem to care. 

I tried to reach out for help last night to an old friend. Haven't spoken to him in months, but he always said he was there if I needed to talk, and I trust him.  But I chickened out. Asked if I could talk to him, he asked what was up and I just couldn't respond. It doesn't seem fair to burden him with my problems. ",depression
"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",SuicideWatch

"Reddit, I've never opened up to anyone with my life problems as much i am now, you're my only help i have.A little bit of background

Im 22 living with my my mom. Ive never seen my father nor asked about him, my mom just told me he was in a bad environment(hung out with druggies and gamblers) when she was pregnant with me so she decided to flee the country and start a new life here. She suffers from major depression and migraine so she hasn't work in the States which puts us on the very bottom of society. Coming from a low income family has never effected me until I hit my teenage years. 

Teens-present day
Okay so ever since i can remember I've grown to be a very unemotional, unmotivated, and an empty person. Nothing in my life or nothing in life excites me but what ever takes a negative part in my life or upsets me, i never talk about it, i just simply keep it inside. I do have friends but i never really care what they talk about. 
My life changed significantly when i met my girlfriend 4 years ago, she was the complete opposite of me, very emotional, loving, and came from a very wealthy family(not that the wealth part matters or anything). she got me motivated to make something of my self, but that relationship just ended 36 hours ago because she felt i can't emotionally fulfill her. The only reason the relationship lasted for so long is because i kept on trying and putting an effort to be someone i found out i can't be.
On top of everything, i can't sleep at nights because i feel like i might die in my sleep and I'm scared shitless of death. i used to believe in god, but as i grew older i drifted away from that belief. Now what makes me depressed above everything else is  not knowing what happens after death and if theres a fucking purpose to life. 
I can't just go on with my life believing we don't exist after we die, i cringe when i imagine an infinite nonexistence and i can't breathe.


I tried to address everything i can, but if theres something missing ill try to be more clear on it. Also I'm sorry if i jump from one subject to another, I'm not the best writer and my relationship went to shit because i can't express myself clearly.",depression

I can't do this anymoreI've hidden away all summer in my room and I can't even leave it to get something to eat without my mom telling me how much she wants me to die. I have to get major surgery on my back and she just keeps saying how she hopes that I die when I do and how my whole family will celebrate. Even if it goes well there's still risks that I could end up paralyzed. She tells me how ugly my back makes me look. I lost all my friends right before summer started and I am so fucking alone and have nobody to even talk to anymore. They made things bearable and I was actually happy and they know about my situation but nobody will even check up on me now. I literally have nobody. I've reached my breaking point and I don't think I can carry on living like this.,depression

"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.
I’m so scared I might do something drastic, I’ve been shaped by fear and anxiety. Idk what to do anymore",SuicideWatch
"the bla bla bla on drugs and crappy health insurance, a rant.* I'll try and keep it succinct.
* 
* Before getting insurance I tried every damn thing imaginable, diet, exercise, supplements, all the OTC stuff available. 
* 
* In April I finally got ""obamacare"" a state version of it. I went to my appointment with a long list of shit that needed investigating/fixing: torn rotator cuff, low thyroid (TBD), depression, anxiety, ADD complicated with 100 extra lbs and low energy. The crappy nurse practitioner (CNP) gives me sertraline/zoloft and schedules me for bloodwork. 
* 
* Nothing out of the ordinary came back with the bloodwork, she refused to investigate further the hypothyroid issue. I just want to get to the bottom of it. I feel like shit, can't lose weight, have no energy, hair is falling out, did I say depressed?
* 
* 
* The SSRI did help for a few weeks on the suicidal ideation (SI) but in the past 2 or so weeks it came back with a vengeance. I get so overwhelmed, nothing is improving, have no joy, happiness, pleasure, or reason to live. I work my ass off to try and make progress in my long long list of troubles. So after 3 months, I decided to get off the sertraline, luckily I never upped it to a high dose, so 50mg to 25, to taking every other day, should be done with that BS in a week or two. Made me stupid, slow, and like a zombie. I hated it. My problem is low dopamine. Alright she says she'd refer me to a psychiatrist. let's see if someone who can have an intelligent discussion about medication is any better. I don't want fucking pharmaceuticals, I'm in this game because it's a last resort. But being a curious monkey, I keep searching. I will get off the pharma and experiment with OTC nootropics and maybe get some gray mkt. stimulants to try out. 
* 
* 
* CNP refuses to treat the low energy, depression, or ADD, she refuses to let me try stimulants even though I've done a ton of research and have a bucket full of INFORMED CONSENT. Nope, no good drugs for you! The next joke is, she wrote ""drug seeking behavior"" in my record, which is a total joke, I just want drugs that work or none at all. Suggested adderall or modafinal and she freaked. fuck you bitch, this is what I want to try, why must you be so impedous? Here, take some blood pressure medication, fuck up your liver and kidneys, make more complications than you already have. Uh, no. 
* 
* 
* The shoulder problem, got an MRI, it's a torn supraspinatos tendon. meeting with orth. surgeon, have referral in the works for phys therapy. I don't want to take fucking pills! NSAIDS are hell, I refuse to take them. I want topical gel or lidocane patch, insurance won't pay for it, but here have some crap that will interact with the SSRI and give you serotonin syndrome. Quit that shit after 1 spike. was awful. What does CNP do? prescribe me NSAIDs! Meloxicam. Nope, not going to take it. all this damn run around and lame drugs so we can write an appeal to the damn insurance bureaucrats to get what I really NEED covered. 
* 
* OK so on the bright side, I got referred to a decent psychotherapist and we're working on it. I go to a PTSD educational group once a week, that is sort of helping, but is getting repetitious on the mindfulness stuff. 

Next week I meet with a career counselor to talk about how to get back to work. this shall be fun. I need to gut the resume and start from scratch, how to make a 9 year gap look good? who the hell knows. ",depression
"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

"[Trigger warning] Excuse for self inflicted burns*I do know the crisis line and used it after when I was having a panic attack.
*I know it's not a healthy thing to do.

But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself.  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.) He's seen my at my worst - but! I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, I'm thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts.


 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine?

"Drank to feel better for the first timeHi.  So, hopefully the people who know me on here won't look too closely at this post, but here goes.

Tonight was the first time I drank to feel better.  It's my friend's birthday, and we're waiting for everyone to get here so that we can go out to eat and celebrate.  While we're waiting, we played some SSB Melee.  Now, I love video games, but I'm not very good at them; I have shitty vision and poor hand-eye coordination.  So, of course, I lost miserably.  And I was a pretty big dick about it.

Now, it's my friend's birthday, and I didn't want to fuck it up, so I left him with our other friends and went to my room to get myself together.  Then, I had a couple beers.  I'm pretty tipsy now--always been a lightweight--and miserable.

Yesterday, there was a post about Mr. Rogers in AskReddit, and it linked me to lots of awesome Mr. Rogers material.  I've been thinking since then.  Why can't I just fucking be nice?  I want so badly to be like Mr. Rogers, to care for people and to love them.  In my head, I feel that way.  But I can never act it out; I'm just a dick and a shitty friend.  I never live up to the person I want to be.  I never even get close.

I know I've rambled a lot, because I'm having trouble articulating what's going on, but I just want to be a good person.  And I'm not, and I'm starting to feel like I never will be.  I'm starting to feel like everyone would just be better off if I went away.",depression

"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she’s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don’t blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn’t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don’t have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can’t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

"Posting Galadriel’s opening monologue every day until I get a girlfriend Day 3 Galadriel: (speaking partly in Elvish)

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.",teenagers

"[21m] Do I have depression? I dont know.Hi reddit. This is my first post in this sub. Normally I try to avoid this sort of thing because for me, I think its easier to ""pretend"" that I'm fine rather than confronting it. But I'm not even sure I'm depressed, or what is wrong with me really. I'd love so much for someone to point me in the right direction, maybe help me to understand whats wrong with me and what I need to do to get better. 

I never have motivation to ANYTHING. Even washing my dishes or changing my sheets is too much. Its easier to just let my plates and dishes build up in my room than to take them into the kitchen. basic things like shaving and showering seem like too much of a chore to bother with. Washing my clothes is such a pain and I usually wear everything I own and let my clothes pile up in my room before I bother with them. I've been unemployed almost six months but I cant be bothered applying for jobs. Its like I have this ability to completely forget about everything that I need to do, and just ignore it or tell myself ""Ill do it later"" (but I never do). 

I always figured depression was about being sad/suicidal. I'm neither of those things. I'm not sad but I'm not happy either. I just am. I don't get excited for things and nor do I dread them. My friends send me texts on facebook and to my phone every day but often I'll just ignore them - replying is too much effort...and besides, what if they're telling me something I don't want to hear? Much easier to tell myself I'll answer ""later"" (but often, i wont for a week or more). Going for a long walk seems to improve my motivation, but only briefly. I usually just end up playing video games all day. I was the happiest person I knew until i was 19, I couldnt even imagine being depressed, I dont know if I have it now or what is wrong with me. 

Any help is appreciated, how can I change my life? What do I need to do? My main concern though is that even if you tell me, I'll tell myself I'll do it tomorrow and just never do it. Urghh. How can I fix my life, someone please help me. ",depression

"Hey, all! Just need some advice, nothing serious :)Hi, guys!
I'm not so much into social networks, but really like reddit, though I actually found it through /r/space subreddit and then I was just amazed at how much you can find almost anything here :D So, I stumbled upon this subreddit, so since I anyway get a lot of ""I don't know what to tell you"", in real life, I thought, hey, why not ask something here. :)

Anyway, I don't think I'm really depressed. I did get a medication for depression and insomnia two years ago, didn't really help, so I stopped, felt good for some time, and then came this year of... I don't know what.
Here's the deal. I'm not really sad about something, not really suicidal or something like that. It's just that feeling I can call apathy (English is not my native language so I may not be so precise :) ). It all started, well, more then a year ago, but I didn't give it much thought then, was sure it will pass.
First, I felt this enormous lack of energy, but I linked it to insomnia. Then insomnia got way weirder- I can't fall asleep, but when I do, it is impossible for me to get up for 12 hours +. I tried crazy and multiple alarms, I asked for people to wake me via phone, in person, anything, but it's impossible for me to stay awake. I don't hear alarms, I shut down phone without realizing/remembering it, if someone wakes me up in person, I just fall asleep while getting dressed etc. So, it got really hard to wake up. Even when I sleep undisturbed through all those wasted hours I wake up tired and don't have energy to do anything. In that period, I lost 20Kg and got some bad habits (started smoking, smoked pot a lot also, but quit now).
Then, it managed to get worse. There are few things I'm passionate about. It was making music (I play guitar, bass and keyboard, used to compose a lot of songs with programmed drums, even released a few albums, and had few gigs), space (thing I love since I can remember, and also had a blog in my native language about SETI, Kepler and space exploration regarding alien life, but was interested in all fields). There were few other things, but those two are the main stuff. I'm a good student (if i pull my shit together, should start my PhD studies this autumn :) ), have a nice relationship etc. My family is a mess, money is a constant problem, but those weren't things that bothered me, because I had all those other things I was happy about.
Then they kinda, it's so sad that I'll say this, stopped making me happy. And it hurts. I haven't completed a song in almost two years. Haven't written a new blog almost the same time. I manage to do work for my studies, but it's slow, I'm crossing my deadlines by far, and not feel motivated.
It's so strange. Honestly, I love all those things. Deep inside, I'm still amazed at all the new space discoveries, yet don't have the energy to write a blog post about it. I so, so, so wish to complete an album that would deal with some things that happened to me a year ago, but all I have is dozen of unfinished ideas that I don't touch anymore. I don't have new ideas. It's like nothing of that makes me happy anymore. Don't know. Just wake up, after sleeping through whole fucking day, feeling like crap, not doing anything, until I go to sleep again. And it makes me feel so bad.
I know this sounds crazy, it's like - damn, you don't do shit with your life and feel bad about it, lol. But it is kinda like that. I can't find motivation to do anything... Like everything became something I should do because it's right/good thing to do, not something I want to do... I don't have new ideas for songs, it's so frustrating. Feels like I've lost myself a year ago and like I will never find myself again... It feels really bad...

"Have been in constant depression for 2 years (20 M)Well, I feel absolutely pathetic posting on here but really... I have no one else to talk to right now. at all. And this is part of the problem. Basically, I have been in this perpetual funk for 2 years now. 2 years ago I was the happiest person alive. I was in Denmark off and on visiting my girlfriend at the time, she was an exchange student I hosted the year before and we started dating. It was a stressful sure having to deal with that but we made it work and I was in general... happy. I loved that little country so much. I miss everything about it. The language, Oh god I wish I had someone to speak it with again, the culture, the people. But we both decided to end it as it was just too much to deal with a relationship that long distance (I live in the US). And cue depression. I figure it is normal for people to get upset after a break up so I thought nothing of it. I just figured I'll get over her like everyone before her. I knew she wasn't happy either. We tried talking after that but it was just really awkward and then I completely ruined it a few months late by getting drunk almost every night and sending unbelievably stupid messages to her that were insulting, pathetic, and just completely disappointing.  after that we just didn't talk. That was even harder for me. She was my best friend before we ever considered dating. So.. life goes on. I went to college. Dated one other person. just one. I broke it off with her, I just wasn't interested in being around people. but I still was extremely upset. It wasn't over her anymore. I just was extremely depressed. I wanted to travel again so badly. But I couldn't go to Denmark again, I just.. I don't know how. My grades started failing. I didn't care. I just let it happen. It wasn't that I partied or anything. In fact, I hate being around people, part of the reason why I am posting on here. Really I would just get drunk by myself in my dorm while my room mate was out because I didn't even really like to talk to him. Now mind you, if you see me, I'm not that weird of a guy. I am fairly attractive, nothing too great but I have a good physic, thanks to 5 years of rugby, so people haven't really understood why I like to seclude myself so much. By most people's standards, I look like the type that would be easy going and out with people all the time. But so I failed and lost all my scholarships, I've always been an A and B student so you would think this would hit me really hard but it didn't. I, again, didn't care. Sure I still think about the girl from denmark now, I know she has a boyfriend that she has dated for a year and is happy, and I honestly am glad she is. I don't care about it anymore. The only thing that upsets me about her anymore is the fact that she is doing so well, dating a guy who has an established career, she is studying at the University of Copenhagen, one of the top schools in Europe, and living very happily with him in the city while I am here sitting on my computer, at a shitty delivery job, living in my parents house, a college drop out, and absolutely no friends besides one Spanish girl who I kept in contact with after university. I just feel unbelievably alone but it's by my own doing. I work at some shitty entry level job with the hope of making enough to make one last trip to europe and then... I figure I'll probably kill myself. I'm at $800 now, I need to save around $8000, as my trip goes from Berlin to Barcelona. I don't know why I am posting this. I guess because I have bottled this up so much for so long. I have no history of mental illness in my family so, it would be very unexpected for me to come out to someone that I am depressed.

I'm battling crippling anxiety and it is beginning to destroy me.After a year of dating my boyfriend, he really wanted me to move in with him and his best friend. We were all pretty close and I lived at home with my parents and desperately wanted to move out. My boyfriend and I didn't have an incredibly healthy relationship but we loved eachother deeply. When he started to go to school it was intense. The program he's in was very demanding and he worked in the morning and went to school at night. Long story short after three months of this program neither of us were getting the attention we needed. 
A very big fight happens about a week and a half ago and I spent Christmas staying at friends' houses because the things he said to me were deplorable but I was willing to forgive him and came home. He then ignored me for two days straight and broke up with  me when I told him to please speak to me. We are currently at a strange point where we share a bed and sometimes he will try to hold me or kiss me and it hurts so bad and I tell him and he gives me little to no response. I was already battling depression before we broke up but I've hit an all new low.

"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
Why do I want to kill myself?
It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.

**Economic**:

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",SuicideWatch

"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",SuicideWatch

"DAE order things online just to have something to look forward to?It's a bit of a problem for me. I lost my job back in August and ever since things have been getting worse. Job search has me down. Haven't gotten a single call-back or interview. For the past month, I've been ordering stuff online just to have something to look forward to. 

I have savings to last me a year and benefits coming in from paying into employment insurance. I suppose this has given me a false sense of security and with all the idle time I have, it's been hard to exercise self control. I tell myself ""no"" and then hours or days later I come back and check out with it anyway. I reason with myself to allow myself to buy these things. 

Most of the things I've bought I ""needed"". I just went overboard. For instance, I bought Molton Brown body wash, body lotion and anti-antiperspirant. When it came time to replace some skincare stuff....I basically went and bought the entire goddamn Jack Black line. Time to replace my toothbrush....yup, went for a Sonicare DiamondClean. Iron broke? Got a nearly $200 Rowenta steam iron. Needed some clothes for fall? Yup. Ordered some stuff from J. Crew, etc. Needed new shoes? Johnston &amp; Murphy. So on and so forth. 

You'd think with all this, I still had a damn job. So now I've tried to exercise some self-control and stop all of this. Get my savings back up to what they used to be. I still have enough for a year but with how shitty my job search has been going, I can't keep doing this. 

It's funny, too, because it's not like I really go anywhere so why spend all this money on shit to smell good and good clothes? Some foolish attempt in hopes it will make me feel better about myself on the outside even if I feel like shit on the inside. I don't know. I really don't.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

If my life was a large puzzle, it’d be like just throwing the entire thing in a fire of shame.

I hear it takes a while to bleed out, If you don’t hit an artery, so people are usually discovered and saved. Fortunately, I live alone in a dorm room and no one ever visits so I have a lot of time. I wrote a note in class addressed to my girlfriend. Looking back at it, it’s kinda all over the place, but I don’t feel like fixing it. I hear if you slit your arm it can cause permanent damage if you fuck up, so I got some medical stuff just in case I wake up and decide not to try again right after. I guess I’m writing this here to make sure people know. I don’t have a history of depression, and haven’t really shown any obvious reasons for something to think I’d ever kill myself. I feel a certain sense of control and calmness and I’m actually looking forward to the time I have to make the decision. If I decide to go through with it, I’ll let you guys know. ",SuicideWatch

"FesteringSometimes I feel as though my depression is like various festering wounds on my body. It helps to give me a real sense that something is wrong, that I'm not okay. Sometimes the old wounds ache and rot and fester and sometimes it's something new, but only one thing appears to be wrong at any given time - even if my body is sick and sweet with rot. The obvious solution occurs to me via daily messages from my subconscious informing me that my presence is no longer needed and that I can finally end the rotting if I just sign here.

"No matter how many times “it gets better”, I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and I’m ready to lie in it.I’m 26 now, have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my 12 year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment. It’s gotten better, but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time. The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead, mourning me and my choices, is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations. Today has particularly been a rocky day though, and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening.

I started having ugly thoughts tonight, like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash. Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out. I’m actually embarrassed to admit this, but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires, it scares me.

For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I don’t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and I’m getting restless.

No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but I’m wondering who’s battle is this actually? I’m definitely not fighting for myself anymore. I’ve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time.",SuicideWatch

"Best resource for mental health help for somebody without a lot of money?I've been dealing with the death of my father for about a year and it comes and goes with how well I can actually deal with it.  The past few months have been especially hard for some reason.  I have very little money left, no immediate family, one friend I see once a week, and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress (and being around me doesn't make it any better).  I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps.  Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me.  Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.

Thanks for listening anyway, helped to type that out.

**Edit:**  To clarify, I am talking about real, actual mental health help - or perhaps medication - not reading self help books, not going for a run, not meditating.  I have done all of those things ad nauseum.  I do them regularly.  I try to fill my life with as much of the ""positive lifestyle"" kind of stuff as I possibly can, but it's not working.  I've read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond.

"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?

Here's what I want to do:

I'll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up. I'll overdose on short acting and long acting insulin, and I'll take over 1g of propranolol, and maybe an antiemetic so I don't vomit the drug. I'll stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousness.

"Anxious about getting diagnosed. Tell me about your experiences with first talking to your doctor about your depression and diagnosis.I'm a 21 year old female and I feel like I've been struggling with undiagnosed depression for the past two or three years. I only just realized I was probably depressed about around the end of last year, which is when I struggled most with suicidal thoughts and a dependency on opiates (I'd been using for two years prior, first as a weekend thing, and then began using daily around summer of last year. I've been clean since January). I was (and still am) extremely apathetic, am prone to sleeping for 12+ hours a day, would skip class and procrastinate because I couldn't bring myself to drive or even get out of bed. Since the beginning of the year, I've made several appointments with my general physician with the goal in mind of getting a diagnosis of my depression, but I keep canceling or skipping out of anxiety. I'm terrified of being told ""I can't be depressed"". If anyone has ever read (and if you haven't, you should, regardless of if you're depressed or not) those ""Adventures in Depression"" posts on Hyperbole and a Half, I relate to Allie Brosh a ton in that my life hasn't been terrible enough to warrant situational depression. And I know that clinical depression isn't the same as situational depression, and it's probably what I have, but I'm still scared of being invalidated, especially by a medical professional. I think part of it is simply that I feel guilty for being depressed when I've had a relatively good life so far. It's part of the reason I haven't told my family yet, and I only recently told my closest friend. 

Tomorrow I plan on visiting a pastor at my old church who helped my family through a really tough time in our lives (especially my mom, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 and passed away in 2010). I wouldn't even call myself Christian anymore, and I haven't seen the dude since 2011, but I feel comfortable turning to him before I talk to my family. In addition, I really want to actually see a doctor soon, but I'm still very anxious about the thought of bringing up my depression with one. I guess that's why I'm here. Tell me about your first experiences in bringing up depression with a doctor and getting diagnosed. Some specific questions I have:

* Who did you see when you got your diagnosis? As in, did you see your general physician, or did you make an appointment with a school counselor, or did you look for a specific clinical therapist or psychiatrist, etc.

* Did you go alone or with family/friends? I guess part of this question is did you tell important people in your life that you might be depressed before you got diagnosed? 

* What can I expect to be asked?

* What can I expect after I get diagnosed? Did they immediately prescribe meds/therapy, how soon would I go back for a checkup, etc.

* Did you get diagnosed for something other than depression or in addition to depression? Is that common?

* What did it feel like to have a diagnosis? I've read a lot about how some people feel like a diagnosis is a life sentence, but for me, I feel like knowing specifically what I'm struggling with and having the validation from a health professional would help me accept that what I'm feeling is real and can be overcome. 

I know a lot of the answers to these questions are readily available online, but having the input of actual people would be helpful in just calming down my anxieties and giving me a better picture of what to expect. I'm sure I'm not the only one that was initially terrified of seeking help.",depression

And I have to say... shopping is terrible.. before you walk in, there’s these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in, and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning.

Then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you (also very uncomfortable), you can’t actually touch any beauty products, like perfume etc... (why would I go shopping if I can’t touch or try anything on?)

I had the same experience at every other shop, and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask... it was not a pleasant experience.

I don’t think I want to go back to shopping ever again if that’s how uncomfortable it’s going to be, I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores, the future will be completely online, and social distanced... and it’s scary.

"Feels worse because my life is great by objective standards, yet still miserable.I am 32. I run my own professional business. I have a high level of education with some level of ""prestige.""  I am relatively good looking, although somewhat overweight. I have a nice family (albeit dysfunctional as hell) who cares about me. I have a new niece who I love and loves me. I did just end a relationship of 3.5 years months ago and have some regrets about that. My partner was sexually abused as a child and our issues were too much for each other, although I gave everything I had.  Part of the reason for the breakups was my depression and anxiety issues.  I have a decent cushion of money and live in a comfortable apartment. I have herpes type one and am scared to reveal this in dating. I have used sex as a drug most of my life, and I feel like I don't have that anymore.  I feel like escorts are probably my only way to go.  I get attention in dating sites and go on dates but don't want to have the talk with them. Even though my last relationship got bad enough that I ended it, I now believe it was the best I'll ever have. 

I'm miserable. And I usually hate myself. No matter how much good i do, or how much praise anyone ever gives me, I know I'm damaged and broken. Because I inevitably return to deep depression.  Many days I am barely holding things together at work. In fact, my inconsistency is one of the things that forced me to go out on my own. 

I can't seem to achieve my goals. Can't get in shape. Nothing seems good or with it anymore.  And even if I shake that feeling, it always comes back. Since childhood. I have taken meds for years. Sometimes they help. I honestly just want to sleep. I am usually in physical pain and there I am not. There I am entertained and free of my thoughts. 
 
I literally forget past events and moments of pleasure, but remember painful ones and failures vividly. 

I think about suicide probably once a week and spend hours googling it. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist regularly. 

And I still can't do it. I have so many assets most people don't, and I can't just consistently be ok.  I am a burden and have passed my prime.  I want to do so many things, but don't have the energy or discipline. 

I am trying to read the book The Mindful Approach To Depression, which I HIGHLY recommend. However I feel too far gone both right now to read the book, and long term. Meaning I think my thought patterns are so ingrained at this point that they are unchangeable.  I think my best times were in high school and are now behind me. I don't believe I make a good partner, and almost feel like getting in a relationship with someone would be doing them a disservice. 

I read in here about people with all sorts of real problems, and it makes me feel all the more pathetic. If I can't feel ok where I am, I am simply defective.

"2929


That’s the oldest I’ve ever been. It’s the oldest I’m ever meant to be.


I don’t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn’t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real… Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you’re lying in bed wondering.


“Did I just wake up… or just fall asleep.”


The fragments don’t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, I’ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I’m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn’t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I’ve cousins who experience the same. We’ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn’t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


I’ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn’t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can’t say for certain why I chose 27… Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I’m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I’ve always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I’d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I’m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who’s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It’s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I’m far from being a master at this myself.


“Why don’t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?”


Is it because that’s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive… Does the family’s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we aren’t clairvoyant. Odds are it’s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I’ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29… am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don’t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I’m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I don’t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can’t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


“How would she react?”


“What would the funeral look like?”


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages… Likely never settling back down into their original position.


That’s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I’ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I’ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others’ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I’m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe… Just maybe 29 isn’t the end… It’s just a new beginning.

"It's my 24th birthday on December 31st. What can I do on my birthday by myself?I haven't planned anything for my birthday. I feel as though my ""friends"" won't even show up anyway. Some distant people who I haven't seen in years will send the obligatory Happy Birthday messages through Facebook and that's it. I don't have any people that I consider close, only many acquaintances whom some also suffer from depression and social anxiety. 

Without sounding too down about myself, I'm a pretty boring person. No qualifications, living at home with parents, no hobbies, kissless virgin and when I'm not working then I'm playing video games.

I ask those who also suffer from depression as I need some advice. I don't make a big deal about my birthday but I still feel as though I deserve to treat myself every once and a while and my birthday seems the best day for it during the year.

If you know that you are a horrible person, have horrendous thoughts, have done thoughtless and rash, even perverse actions in the past and most likely will again in the future, is suicide justified?

"It is just so hardI'm not really sure what I find the hardest thing about everything. I self-diagnosed (yeah you heard right - call the cops) bipolar type II and I've wanted for so long to just get a real diagnosis done and start therapy. But when I'm depressed I just have zero power and motivation to do so (and anything else). I'd have to do phone calls and meet with so many people and talk about stuff I don't want to pronounce. I can't usually focus enough on the future to realize it would be worth going through all that shit. I just let this world perform its painful procedures on me and think about pleasing ways to escape.
When I'm (hypo)manic (but this is rare anyway) I just don't think as a coherent me anymore and assuming I'd be able to get help then is quite silly.
I will probably need meds to get over this shit as I'm not sure right now how CBT or psychoanalysis might help me. But I don't want to have to depend on some med all my life. Then again I am not sure why I care so much about my life in the first place.

I just want to switch off and have others take care about me but I don't even have time for that, I just keep walking somehow. I realized two years ago that I want to start therapy and everything but I'm just incapable of it. I'm almost 18y/o and my parents aren't that understanding similarly to my friends (well I have a single friend who doesn't get upset about me always expressing that I'm tired and sometimes being hyper for a while, but after all she behaves just so similarly as me) I thought I should start therapy once I'm 18 because then I don't have to tell my parents word about it but I know exactly that I won't do anything this time either and to be honest I'm also not sure if I will get 18 this year but this is another thing.

"I just don't want to anymore. I'm tired of life and basically I'm tired of competing. I don't want to do anything anymore. I wanted all this stuff like a house and a family but I don't have the mental abilities to make that happen. I'm sick of talking to people or interacting with them at all. I had a nightmare a couple of months ago where I traveled into the future. I saw myself still in the same place with the same problems. People were making fun of me. I felt like mankind didn't need me here.

I'm just fed up with trying. I never have enough to get what I want or need sometimes.

I'll be in my 40's soon. I've never had more than $200 in the bank. I can't afford school. I tried for 15 years after I finished high school to get into college. I was always turned down for grants and loans. I don't even have any friends anymore. It wouldn't matter if I did, I wouldn't talk to them anyway.

For the past 4 years I feel like I've just been killing time until I die.

I just can't stay enthusiastic about life when nothing positive really happens. All I have to be thankful for is I can walk to my work and there's a gas station close enough to walk to where I can buy canned soup and potato chips to eat. 

I had all these dreams, some which I knew I may never reach but nothing has worked out. I'm always broke, there's no way to save money, I've lived in more states than I can remember. I'm tired of moving around and there's no opportunity to improve things. It's like hitting the reset button on the life is going to suck game.

"People whose depression makes them go prolonged periods without eating: are you still hungry, or not?A common symptom of depression is loss of appetite, and I'm trying to work out if I fall into this.

While I've never gone a full day without eating, I sometimes eat my first meal at about 6pm.

But the thing is, I'm absolutely starving during this time, I just can't be bothered to go and get something to eat. Like, my stomach will be rumbling constantly.

Also, when I do eventually eat something, it is a full-sized meal (and then some more), I don't just force down a sandwich and call that a meal.

But when I hear about people with depression not eating, I get the impression it's because they genuinely feel no need to eat, rather than only not doing so out of laziness. And indeed, I'm not exactly ""losing"" my appetite, I'm just too lazy to please it.

I guess I'm just looking for clarification on whether my situation is the norm or not.

"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it.",SuicideWatch

"no rewards for resistensehi reddit. i am an anon. i do not know why i am postting this reaaly. perhaps a chance to hear myself speak? perhaps an open forum to categorise my thoughtS? perhaps just because... and because is enough.

ten years ago i gave up on life. i crossed a lne.

it's not despair or depression that keep me beyond that line. it is fatigue.

a member of my family was suisidal. to my knowledge they still are. we don not speak about it. we are unable to now.

i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.

they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.

three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?

their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.

eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.

i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.

we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.

i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.

that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.

they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.

we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.

they did not die.

years pass.

i move on.

they move on.

that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.

time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.

while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.

god it's such a struggle.

that memory of surrender haunts me.

but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.

so i weather.

i endure.

i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.

i no longer know how to handle compliments.

my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.

i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.

and i never feel satisfaction.

that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.

that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.

i'm so tired.

and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.

""you should feel pride""

""take some credit""

and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""

i feel worthless when that happens.

so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.

i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.

i fake it.

i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.

when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.

where no one will be dragged in to my void.

where no one will watch me dead on the inside.

where no one will offer pity.

no shame.

no being locked in like i once was.",SuicideWatch

"I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI've graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I'd got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams. I've graduated with 3.2/4 gpa score. I've gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme, I've played in a great band for the first 3 years of my university life, had been selpt with 5-6 women which I had a serious relationship that last 2.5 years with 2 of them. I've graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies. My first ever game had got downloaded by 2 million people during my first job experience. This year at 14th Februrary, everything was changed. My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy, my parents got divorced (and they were very verbal to me about this topic), I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries (totally different industry that I'd imagine for my career). I dont know, I think I've accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better. 

I could do better if I was living in a different country, I could do better if I didn't waste my time on two long serious relationships. I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent's offer to pay for it (I didn't want to make them pay for MY education). I could do better if I didn't have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme. I could do better if I didn't stop making music or writing poems and stories, I could do better if I didn't take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey. Everything I did seems like a failure to me. And worst of all, I've gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is on the ground, I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything.

Anyways, for people around me, I am a succesfull, mature, intellectual, functioning person with interesting hobbies. But inside of my mind, these things just doesn't matter. I was so pumped by my parents, my friends and my girlfriends, nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills (social, artistic, general etc.). 

I dont add value to anyone around me. Noone needs me, Noone craves for my love, needs my support, needs me around them. 

I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers. But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them. I can not seem to get laid nowadays, if you exclude some of my ex gf's. that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life (and boy, it was great). I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to. I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions. I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I'm an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. 

Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe ""highly cultural"" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn't give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. 

Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn't and I am not confident the way I express myself. 

This life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don't know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I've sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don't know.

Death, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I've been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn't feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn't care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn't be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn't care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable. ",SuicideWatch

"I'm so sick of everythingI'm sick of the routine; everyday waking up, getting ready and going to work. Feeling forced to go to college one day a week to earn a career I doubt I'll be alive to pursue. 

I know that maintaining this routine is good and better than wallowing, but by God, do I want to wallow. I want to sit in my grief and let the storm in my head take control and allow my misery to wash over me. I want my despair to manifest and I want to let the pain out. I don't want to be sitting in work, pretending to smile and politely declining cups of teas while I'm one nerve left from throwing myself out of the window. I am dead inside, with cold eyes but I want to rage, and cry and weep at my desolation. 

I'm sick of being lonely. Abandonment from my friends led me to easily hate them and now I am alone. They didn't understand the war I am fighting, and I doubt they ever will. But they still left and I am left rattling around my own head and thoughts. I want to weep while someone strokes my head, someone who loves me and someone who believes I am worth staying alive. 

Because I am sick of being alive. The loneliness washes over me daily and I attack my reflection. I just don't know how much more of being inside my own head I can take. ",depression

We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we ""dated"" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don't try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways.

"Depression before and during pregnancy. Can anyone share their experience?I hope it's ok to ask for people's input on this as it's a bit awkward and definitely a less than ideal situation.

I have a personality disorder and suffer with major depressive disorder (recurrent bouts of bad depression throughout my life). These are things I've been dealing with and had some help with the past 10 or so years, mostly therapy and medication. I don't really do well off medication.

Before I became pregnant, I was taking efexor (quite a high dose) for the past 3 years. Doctor wanted me off it when we found I was pregnant so I quickly tapered down as much as I could and then she switched me over to prozac (as she says this is safer to take during pregnancy).

However, my mood has been very low the past couple of weeks. I've only been on prozac a few days (no more efexor) and she said it'll take 4 weeks to build up in my system. I'm crying all the time, I can't sleep, don't feel hungry, don't care to look after myself, been missing work, and my partner has been pretty frustrated at me (says he's there for me but then starts yelling or slamming doors for things like ""not coming up to the bedroom to say hello"" to him when I got home). I've been trying to fake happy and act normal but at this stage I can't be bothered anymore.

I'm starting to feel pretty helpless. My Mum says I need to just get on with it for the baby's sake but I'm struggling a lot and the constant nausea and vomiting is probably keeping me low too.

Does anyone have any experience with depression and pregnancy who can share their opinion/story? Or feeling urges to self harm etc. while pregnant (these aren't strong yet and only fleeting thoughts)?

I hope this is ok to ask... I just dunno where to turn anymore.",depression

"Introducing myself/rant (as i plan to be on here often for a bit)Hey i'm a 27 year old male and I've been depressed ever since i could remember. I feel my depression is stemmed from not being able to be close to women because of the childhood i lived. Raised by a single mom who wasn't there emotionally most of the time. My dad abandoned me pretty much. Not saying my mom didn't or doesn't love me; i know she does. But certain details of my life has made me notice things, which made me apathetic to everything. I have changed my act so many times and honestly i hate it. I never finished highschool because i was an unsettling kid. Had a huge temper and was unapproachable. Because of my fuck ups i'm in my current situation. I don't regret not going. Because while i am always depressed i do not see my predicament a terrible thing. To be honest there's a lot wrong with me that i will withhold from saying on this thread as it's private but i will say it's prevented me from holding down jobs for longer than 6 months. Up til bout 4 years ago due to some more complicated physchological fuck ups i developed a phobia that prevented me from going outside. I finally stepped up bout a year ago, still having a hard time holding down jobs even though i'm pretty good at my profession. I always want more. I think this year alone though i have progressed so much. I have been with women before but always felt detached. I met someone who'm i finally i guess want to say fell for and well yesterday it was iterated it wasn't gonna happen. The brief moments of happiness i felt round her to me was worth it. I'm still depressed; know i will always be depressed but i just needed to say the brief moments of happiness i spent around her is one of the best things that happened to me.

"I'm not sure what I'm feeling?To preface, I'm not entirely sure I'm clinically depressed. I've never been officially diagnosed, but I've suspected it for a long time now. 

I'm not sure if I'm sad, angry, or if I'm just in some catatonic state void of emotion(?). I don't know how to explain exactly what I'm feeling at all. Does anyone else have trouble putting the right words to what you're feeling? How do you even know you're depressed? How do you know you're not just in some rut or there's some other reason for feeling this lost? Everything is so confusing. 

It's not like there's anything specifically catastrophic in my life nor is there some dramatic, inimical source for how I feel. I've never suffered through abuse or hardship, I've never even experienced the death of a family member or friend. I've just been here occupying space. I'm not sure what the next step would be for me. Is there even a next step I should take? Am I just doing this for attention or something? Is there some type of bias in my mind that is tricking me into pretending I'm depressed to get at something else? Why would I post this if not for some attention, right?

"Serious memory issues and fatigue, what can I do?Hello,

I've been becoming more and more worried about my health in relation to my depression. I started up on an SSRI (Lamotrigine) a couple of months ago, and had some bad brain fog and memory problems, but I thought it was probably normal so I kept going, and finally stopped taking it after I got serious emotional blunting and couldn't enjoy anything at all. That was about a month ago, but it's just gotten worse. Now, when I was younger, my memory wasn't ever really the best. But now you can be talking to me and I'll forget everything you just said. I'll forget what I'm saying mid-sentence. I can be driving and suddenly forget where I'm going. I've always been a top notch speller and I find myself forgetting how to spell longer words. My job performance has dropped and I constantly feel like I'm using 100% of my memory capacity. I've also realized that I'm becoming insanely tired  and hungry over everything. I could wake up after a 9 hour rest, run to the store to shop for a few things, and then come back an hour later and go back to sleep for four more hours. I never could sleep during the day before but now I can sleep anytime. 

I'm really beginning to get worried, because the mistakes are becoming more and more noticeable and I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm 19 years old, living on my own, and I need the job/life I have to survive. I don't have a primary Doctor as none of the PCPs in my area are accepting patients. I used to have a psychiatrist but he was very incompetent when it came to just about everything (refills/prescriptions, reminders, never checked up on me when I didn't show). I am having immense difficulty finding anyone else in my area. What can I do?",depression
"Started lexapro about a month ago... Can't sleepAlmost a month ago I started taking 10mg of Lexapro for my depression. The side effects weren't too bad in the beginning. The worst part was the weird dreams and not being able to sleep. A month later, these are the only side effects that I am still having and it is driving me crazy. I sleep good until 3 or 4 in the morning then I lay in bed awake for the rest of the night. Sometimes I can fall asleep again but it is usually a few hours. I take my medication at 11pm before going to bed at midnight. Could I take it around 8? would this help with the sleep issues",depression
